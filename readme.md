# Nickerator

I have decided to write this code after using Sherlock (another tool used to find social media accounts)
So I have used some of the most commons patterns to names in social medias that I have found.

# Patterns used

- Uses the initial of one name with the other that was passed 
- Replace the vowels with x, v and numbers 
- Add dot and underscore in different patterns to the name 

# Usage 

python nickreator.py -w firstName secondName -o outputFile.txt

For a better experience I would recommend only passing 2 or 3 parameters to the -w option
